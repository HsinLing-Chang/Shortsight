## Technical Highlights

- ### Shortcode Generation Flow

  Redisâ€™s INCR command obtains a global, atomic integer ID, which is then salted and encoded using the Hashids algorithm into a fixed 6-character shortcodeâ€”guaranteeing collision-free, consistent URL lengths without database locking.

  1. **Atomic ID**  
     Call Redisâ€™s `INCR` to get a globally unique integer.

  2. **Encode with Hashids**  
     Use the [Hashids](https://pypi.org/project/hashids/) library to turn that integer into a 6-character alphanumeric code.

  3. **Save to database**  
     Save the short code into database so we can look it up on redirects.

- ### **Asynchronous Event Storage**

  To avoid slowing down redirects under heavy traffic, all click events are enqueued to an AWS SQS queue. AWS Lambda functions then consume and persist these events to the database asynchronously, decoupling event recording from the user-facing redirect path.

  1. **Parse & Enqueue**  
     Backend server parses the User-Agent and Referer, builds a JSON payload, and enqueues it to AWS SQS.

  2. **Buffer in SQS**  
     AWS SQS buffers incoming events to smooth out traffic spikes and prevent blocking the redirect path.

  3. **Poll & Consume**  
     AWS Lambda polls the SQS queue, retrieves pending messages, and prepares them for storage.

  4. **Save to Database**  
     Lambda functions write the consumed events into the database asynchronously, decoupling event recording from the user-facing redirect.
